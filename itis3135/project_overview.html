        <h2 class="center">Freelance Architecture & Development</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            My web design application is intended to promote the professional projects of my client to potential
            employers and contractors online.
            The intended users are architecture recruiters and employers who are recruiting for positions both in the
            area and remotely.
            The content of this website will consist of general information about my client himself including his
            qualifications and skillset, information about his design processes, and also samples of architecture work
            from his portfolio.
        </p>
        <h3>Client</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Name:</b> Prince Bull</li>
            <li><b>Organization:</b> None, currently freelance</li>
            <li><b>Email:</b> Prince-Bull-Jr@outlook.com</li>
            <li><b>Phone:</b> 919-943-6655</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Page Design</h3>
        <h4>Home</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The first page of the website will be called "Home" and will be used to catch the eye of the customer
                reader.
            <li>For this content page, I will include an image of my client to humanize them to the reader, and also
                include some images of his completed architecture work so they can immediately get the idea of what the
                whole webpage is for.
            <li>Users will not be asked to enter data on this page, and thus no data validation is necessary.</li>
            <li>This page will only contain hyperlinks to other webpages via its navbar at the top. The navbar may have
                a dropdown on one of its options that allow the reader to visit multiple different personal/professional
                projects of my client.</li>
            <li>Images on this page will be clickable to enlargen them to the reader and get a better view of the
                content.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The second page of the website will contain an "About Me" and will host the more detailed qualification
                and contact information about my client.</li>
            <li>This page will have more images of my client and also images of software tools and systems that pertain
                to his expertise. In a way, this will be a relay of his resume, but in a much more stylized manner.
                Contact information will also be included on this page if a user would like to contact my client for
                further inquiries.</li>
            <li>The images on this part of the site here will also be expandable. There will also be a clickable link to
                download a PDF copy of his resume on the page.</li>
            <li>Aside from the resume link, this page will also contain a navbar to the other pages on the website.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Design Process</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The "Design Process" page will contain a thesis on the design skills and processes of my client.</li>
            <li>This page will be mostly text-intensive, but like other pages it will also include expandable images
                that relate to the subject matter and act as a visual aide.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Projects</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The final two or three pages of this project will be centered around some of my client's completed
                projects and will walk through the general design of these finished projects. They will each have their
                own page as to contain their information without overlap, however there is the potential for a master
                "Projects" page to be added as well that helps to describe each and allows them to be clicked to be
                taken to the full description page.</li>
            <li>This will lead into having enough pages to meet the page requirements of the website, it is just that
                the number of projects that can be displayed must be finalized with my client.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Dynamic Functionality</h3>
        <p>
            The dynamic functionality of this website will primarily be centered around image expansion and galleries of
            images of both floor plans and final products of architechtural design on the website. These are intended to
            display the ability
            of my client in a more easily digestible manner for any users. A prime example is <a
                href="https://x.com">x.com</a> (formerly Twitter), where users can click on images in posts to expand
            them and also scroll between multiple images in a post as if it were a gallery.
