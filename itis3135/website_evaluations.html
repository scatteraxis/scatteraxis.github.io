        <h3>Website 1: <a href="https://www.fromjapan.co.jp/en/">FromJapan</a></h3>
        <p>
            FromJapan is a proxy bidding website that allows western users to bid on and purchase goods from Japan.

        <ul>
            <li><b>Contrast</b> - The dark text color contrasts the white background, and the shade of blue on the links is still readable on the white background too.</li>
            <li><b>Repetition</b> - The design for selecting categories of items and then items for sale/auction themselves is consistent within themselves, so are tabs and headings.</li>
            <li><b>Alignment</b> - Alike items are center aligned into a grid to keep their styling consistent, and so they can all be recognized for their function easily.</li>
            <li><b>Proximity</b> - Alike item categories, and from there purchase/biddable items are also styled in the same grid as one another to link their similarities.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Website 2: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021123102321/http://www.angelfire.com/mo3/ssbm/Smashbro.html">A Super Smash Brothers Melee fan site</a> that dates back to November 2002</h3>
        <p>
            This website appears to be a website dedicated to chronicling information about the 2001 platform fighting game <em>Super Smash Brothers Melee</em>. It carries information and images about both characters and items in the game. This is a page I've had bookmarked for a while for humorous purposes but the fact that I can actually use it for the bad website example on this assignment in this class makes it even better.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Contrast</b> - Contrast on the main page is AWFUL, has blue hyperlinks placed on top of a blue glitter background image. Also, if you go to any character's intro page, the text is placed directly on top of whatever background image for the charcater is there.</li>
            <li><b>Repetition</b> - The layout between each type of page happens to be relatively consistent, however some character introduction pages tend to have alignment variance between each (left vs right vs centered)</li>
            <li><b>Alignment</b> - Alignment for tables is very standard, but again text alignment is inconsistent or misleading on certain pages such as Pokeball pulls</li>
            <li><b>Proximity</b> - Alike content on character moveset pages do in fact stick together (regular attacks vs special attacks have separate design, but each type stay closer to alikes than others)</li>
        </ul>
