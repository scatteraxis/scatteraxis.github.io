        <h3>What are fighting games?</h3>
        <p>
            Fighting games are a type of action video game where the core of the gameplay features combat between two or
            more
            players fighting each other on screen. This gameplay style was widely popularized by the commercial success
            of
            Capcom's <i>Street Fighter</i>, and most iconically its sequel and updates to <i>Street Fighter II</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are various different types of fighting games:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>"Footsies" fighters:</b> Fighting games that stick to a more grounded and slower paced approach
                to gameplay. Examples include the <i>Street Fighter</i> series and <i>Mortal Kombat</i> series.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>"Anime" fighters</b>: A term that has been used to refer to fighting games that contain the traits of
                both an "anime" visual or graphical style, and also a heavy focus on having many universal or
                character-specific mechanics. This design philosophy dates back to Capcom's <i>Darkstalkers</i> series
                of games, however it was massively popularized by Arc System Works' <i>Guilty Gear</i> franchise soon
                after.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>"3D" fighters:</b> Fighting games that make use of 3D space for the fighters instead of the much more
                common 2D space. Many of these games forgo certain special mechanics from other genres of fighting games
                and instead aim for a much more "intense" or "realistic" fighting system based on real-world martial
                arts and fighting technique.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="center">About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Agyei, and I am a 22 year old born and raised in Charlotte, NC, but my parents came to this
            country from Ghana. I knew fighting games existed for a while as a child, but I never really dived
            into one until I stumbled upon the arcade fighting game <i>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Heritage for the
                Future</i>, which was a licensed fighting game based on my favorite manga/anime series (at the time) of
            the same name. This was the first fighting game I ever legitimately tried to get good at, and it kickstarted
            my love for the genre as a whole, though ironically enough I kind of now hate most of the first few fighting
            games I tried to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
            To this day I still play fighting games very often if not every day. I like to spend a lot of my free time
            researching more
            obscure games in the genre such as various licensed fighting games that severely underdocumented and
            underrepresented.

        <h3>When do I play fighting games?</h3>
        <p>
            For me, any time is a good time for playing fighting games, as long as I can find a friend or training
            partner to play with. If not, any time is also a good time to practice and study the game on my own in
            training modes. For a real answer,

        <h2 class="center">Where?</h2>
        <h3>Where do I play fighting games?</h3>
        <p>
            You can play most fighting games from the comfort of your room thanks to the Internet, however most fighting
            game players such as myself like to meet up with friends and other players in real life as they are much
            better enjoyed socially rather than alone or against faceless opponents. At UNCC, I meet up with my friends
            just about every day in a common area in the Student Union ("Norm's Loft") to run games.

            We also host one club event a month for any fighting game players in the area to come get some games, meet
            people, and have fun.

        <h2 class="center">Why?</h2>
        <h3>Why do I play fighting games?</h3>
        <p>
            I play fighting games because I believe them to be one of the most technically and mechanically interesting
            genres of games out there, which is very entertaining to me. Many of these games have been played for years
            and years since they released with absolutely no updates because their core gameplay is so well thought out
            and facilitates players sticking around to explore the systems for a very, very long time. There is always
            something interesting to pick out and research in any fighting game, and also so many to go through with. No
            two fighting games are ever the same, with most of them being only loosely comparable.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm also very invested in the community aspect of fighting games. The communities for many of these games
            are all purely in it for the love of the game(s) for what they are and the love of self-improvement in their
            play. Compared to modern games, it's very refreshing seeing people enjoy a game for what it is over "what it
            could become" or "what it could have been".

    <section id="section6" class="hidden">
        <h2 class="center">How?</h2>
        <h3>How can I get started playing fighting games?</h3>
        <p>
            It's as easy to start playing as any other game genre. Find a game that you think looks cool, and you get it
            and you play it. Most games have a tutorial
            and some singleplayer modes for you to play, and once you feel like you're adept with them you can then try
            playing the games versus people online or in person. There are also fighting games on every game system, so
            they are fairly accessible as well.

        <p>
            There are also many websites that host information repositories of how to play many games, and also
            important technical data within the games such as frame data and hitboxes.
