        <h3>Personal Background</h3>
        <p>
            I'm a 22 year old Charlotte resident, but both of my parents came here from Ghana before I was born.
        </p>
        <h3>Academic Background</h3>
        <p>
            I am a Data Science senior graduating this fall, also minoring in Software Development.
        </p>
        <h3>Professional Background</h3>
        <p>
            I don't have much professional experience in Data Science or programming outside of my penultimate and
            Capstone projects for my major; I'm currently seeking internships to fill this experience void.
        </p>
        <h3>Programming/Software Background</h3>
        <p>
            I've taken ITSC-3155 over the summer so I have some rudimentary experience with HTML and JavaScript but need
            to study more. I've also become moderately familiar with it from working on certain wikis online (i.e.
            Dustloop, Mizuumi). Aside from this, I'm proficient in Python, Java, and MySQL.
        </p>
        <h3>Primary Computer Platform</h3>
        <p>
            Windows 10 Laptop
        </p>
        <h3>Courses I'm Taking and Why</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>ITIS-3135 - Web App Design and Development: Taking it to properly learn HTML &amp; CSS, and required to
                fulfill my minor degree.</li>
            <li>CJUS-1511 - Local Social Science: Need credits to graduate</li>
            <li>AFRS-1100 - Intro to Africana Studies: Need credits to graduate</li>
            <li>ANTH-1501 - Intro to Anthropology: Need credits to graduate</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>I'd Also Like To Share:</h3>
        <p>
            I'm a huge fighting game fan. I also like retro gaming a lot as I own a PlayStation 2, Wii, and Dreamcast.
