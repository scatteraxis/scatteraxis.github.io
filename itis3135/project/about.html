                Compton scattering (or the Compton effect) is the quantum theory of high frequency photons scattering
                following an interaction with a charged particle, usually an electron. Specifically, when the photon
                hits electrons, it releases loosely bound electrons from the outer valence shells of atoms or molecules.
                <br> <br>
                The effect was discovered in 1923 by Arthur Holly Compton while researching the scattering of X-rays by
                light elements, and earned him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1927. The Compton effect significantly
                deviated from dominating classical theories, using both special relativity and quantum mechanics to
                explain the interaction between high frequency photons and charged particles.
                <br> <br>
                Photons can interact with matter at the atomic level (e.g. photoelectric effect and Rayleigh
                scattering), at the nucleus, or with just an electron. Pair production and the Compton effect occur at
                the level of the electron.[1] When a high frequency photon scatters due to an interaction with a charged
                particle, there is a decrease in the energy of the photon and thus, an increase in its wavelength. This
                tradeoff between wavelength and energy in response to the collision is the Compton effect. Because of
                conservation of energy, the lost energy from the photon is transferred to the recoiling particle (such
                an electron would be called a "Compton Recoil electron").
