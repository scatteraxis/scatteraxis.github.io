            <h2>About Prince Hycy Bull Jr.</h2>
            <p>
                "I am a 24-year old freelance architect that graduated from the Georgia Institute
                of Technology, and am now currently studying for my Master's degree in Architecture. For the past five
                years, I have studied the intricacies of Architecture and Graphic Design to hone my craft, and
                eventually contribute to something greater.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although most of my technical skills stem from my education, I hold dearly many lessons from my Sierra
                Leonian descent. In my culture, there is a strong sense of community, where it takes a village to raise
                a child. To truly learn, is to learn with others as you take steps to grow in tandem.
            </p>
            <p>
                Architecture and Design is much more than just putting buildings and art into the site. It's a way to
                interconnect with the "village" you build with your team, and the communities you with to impact with a
                message of comraderie.
            </p>
            <p>
                The type of designer I strive to be is one that disparages belief that the praxis of working in
                isolation proves fruitless, as you'll always need someone's guidance at every level."
