                The <em>Photovoltaic Activated Network for the Generation of Life-Saving Initiatives</em> (PANGLIN) is
                an architecture project focused on developing a structure to be used for the emergency control and relief
                for a town or city. It is also intended to be extremely eco-conscious by utilizing net zero
                environmental impact structures.

                <em>Terraine de Jeau</em> is a project that aims to create a sustainable park that promotes
                eco-friendliness and serves as a model for sustainable urban development. The park will provide a space
                for people to connect with nature, engage in outdoor activities, and learn about sustainable living
                practices.

            <p>
                The aim of <em>Faltenweglich</em> was to design a mobile structure for a public space, which can serve a
                range of cultural events. It takes inspiration from the Origami concept of tessellation, which refers to
                an arrangement of polygonal shapes closely fitted together in a repeated pattern without gaps or
                overlapping.
